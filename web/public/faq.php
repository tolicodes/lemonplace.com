			<div class="questions">
				<h2>“Lets get those creative Juices flowing”</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Do you do websites?</h3>
						<p>Yes. Really good ones if we may say so ourselves.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>How about iPhone and Android apps?</h3>
						<p>Yes.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Can you make the logo bigger?</h3>
						<p>Certainly.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Do you do copywriting?</h3>
						<p>Yes. just check out our services page already</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>This is a bit embarrassing but what is copywriting?</h3>
						<p>Nah, ‘tis nothing to be ashamed of. Copywriting is writing copy (text) for the purpose of advertising or marketing. The copy is meant to persuade someone to buy a product, or influence their beliefs.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>How long does it take?</h3>
						<p>It depends on the complexity of the project and the mood of the designers and clients.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Well, how long does it usually take to make a logo or flyer?</h3>
						<p>Although not a guarantee, a logo project is usually done in about 4-15 days, a flyer can be done in even less time than that.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>And a website?</h3>
						<p>Anywhere from around 1-16 weeks.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>So you can make something like Facebook in less than 16 weeks?</h3>
						<p>Woha. We can try, but such a big project usually takes longer. Even the best designers and engineers are still developing Facebook, a site that began development in 2003.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<h3>Can i come to your office to watch you do your magic?</h3>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>What do I need to provide?</h3>
						<p>Typically we’ll need your brand assets like your logo, color guide etc. and any images or text you haven't hired us to create before the project can begin.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>What file formats do we get? </h3>

						<p>We provide standard formats such as JPEG, PNG (transparent backgrounds), PDF, Ai and EPS (vector). make sure to let us know what format you’ll need before we begin the project.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>How about the working files like PSD’s?</h3>
						<p>We can share them for a 10% setup fee (we clean up the files and provide the necessary fonts.)</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<h3>My printing company said it needs “something or other” marks and bleeding, can you do that?</h3>
						<p>Of course we can! Crop marks, also known as trim marks, are lines printed in the corners of your publication's sheet to show the printer where to trim the paper. They are used by commercial printers for creating a print where an image or color on the page needs to extend  (bleed) all the way to the edge of the paper.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Why is there so much white space?</h3>
						<p>Although you have a lot to show and tell your customers, it is best not to overload them with too much content all at once, this can make the viewer or reader feel overwhelmed and toss out your brochure at the nearest dump.</p>
						<p>White space (sometimes referred to as negative space) is important to help give structure and focus to the important elements on the page.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<h3>What if I’m not happy with the design?</h3>
						<p>Thats impossible, im sure you’ll love what we’ll whip up for you.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<h3>I know, but you know, like, what if?</h3>
						<p>Well if you're really concerned we encourage you to: <br>
						A. look at some of our previous projects to see what you can expect. <br>
						B. make sure we have a clear understanding of what you want before we start the project. Send us samples of brands, logo’s, themes or styles you like so we can get a picture of which direction you want us to take.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Can you just make 20 and i’ll choose?</h3>
						<p>Sure, just expect this project to take a really long time and prepare to not feel satisfied with the one you chose in the end, because your brother and mother like version 1 and 3 best, but your spouse or boss really likes the style in version 17.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Can you throw a quick logo together for me?</h3>
						<p>Can i ask what kinda logo you’re looking for? A simple logo mark like the “swoosh” that nike uses would obviously take quicker to make than a more complex logo like the one the “porsche” company uses, plus keep in mind that no matter how quick it takes theres an $150 minimum rate.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>What if you dont like it?</h3>
						<p>You’ll never ever see something we don't like. If we show it to you it means we believe that this concept is awesome and just needs a bit of iteration till completion. Of course not all of our clients are brave enough to trust our taste so we’ll show you an early draft of the project before we spend the time to develop it further.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Can you touch up this design my nephew made in publisher?</h3>
						<p>Nope, our experienced taste will just muddle this “too magnificent to be real” piece of art. Maybe just frame it and sell it at an auction.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Can you make it look exactly like this?</h3>
						<p>That would be theft and is illegal (to be more clear, we would never do that for you.)</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>I need something done yesterday, can you help me?</h3>
						<p>Our time machine is malfunctioning at the moment, though we can rush a project at a premium rate of $150 per hour, if we haven't taken on other commitments already.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Can i call you at 1am, or i can call 7am if thats better?</h3>
						<p>You can call whenever you want, we never sleep, ever. No really, we don't. Best times to reach us are between 10am and 6pm.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>How are you so patient with all these ridiculous questions?</h3>
						<p>Chock it up to the cost of doing business, plus we’re a group of really good people.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>How come you designed it classy when i asked for modern?</h3>
						<p>Hmm. We designed classy because that is a form of modern. did you mean hipster? <br>
						In general, try to be as specific as possible with the direction you would like us to take, as many “buzzwords” such as “pop”, “edgy”, or “modern” can mean many different things.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<h3>Can you add this entire article to the business card plus these five affiliate brand logos?</h3>
						<p>Can you add this entire article to the business card plus these five affiliate brand logos? <br>
						We can do anything, we even fix toilets. /s</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Where can i find out more about the Designers, Photographers and Developers at Lemon Place?</h3>
						<p>Over here</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<h3>Can we keep this job a secret, like not post it on your Facebook and stuff?</h3>
						<p>If the content of the project is of a private nature rest assured that we take your privacy very seriously. <br>
						Unfortunately, if you just want to sell our work as your own, we cannot accommodate your request for secrecy and reserve the right to delight in our work and show it off to our friends or prospective clients.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>I know someone that would be perfect for you, can i set you up?</h3>
						<p>You know this question is public, right?</p>
					</li>

			<div class="questions">
				<h2>“Lets pay the bills”</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>How much will it cost?</h3>
						<p>Obviously every project is different but here's the gist of it:</p>
						<p>We charge $150 for every hour of creative work including design, copywriting, web development, photography etc. with a minimum rate of one hour.</p>
						<p>You pay standard costs for web hosting, domain names, stock images etc. (don't worry nothing will be purchased on your behalf without your explicit authorization)</p>
						<p>Printing can be done at a printer of your choice, though you’ll probably get a better deal printing with us. <br>
						with so many variables to choose from like shape, size, colors, paper quality, texture, foil stamping, printing volume... it would be impossible to quote a price for every possible printing configuration, but heres some of the more common projects to give you a feel for cost:</p>
						<p>Flyers: 5.5 x 8.5, double sided, full color, glossy, card stock. 1,000 prints,		$67 <br>
						Business cards: 3 x 2, double sided, full color, glossy, card stock. 1,000 prints, 	$17 <br>
						Postcards: 4 x 6 double sided, full color, glossy, card stock. 1,000 prints,		$43 <br>
						Outdoor banner: 4' x 8' single sided, full color, waterproof material,			$57</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>I know exactly what I want, can I get a discount on your price, because you won’t have to do as much work?</h3>
						<p>We think our pricing structure accommodates clients like yourself perfectly, you only pay us for the man hours we spend on a project.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Can you give me an estimate?</h3>
						<p>We’d be happy to give you a non-binding dollar figure based on our understanding of your needs, and our past experience with similar projects. </p>

						<p>We would like to stress “non-binding” because our clients always seem surprised (when the final invoice is lower than the quote), or shocked (when the final invoice is higher than the quote), even though we make it as clare as we can that we don't know what the future holds and that our quote  is a “non-binding” estimate based almost entirely off our experience with projects that seem similar to yours. </p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<h3>How much do i pay up front?</h3>
						<p>Before we begin work on your project, we take a down payment equal to fifty percent of the quote we gave you. A lower percentage of thirty percent is taken with larger projects estimated higher than $5,000 with retainers of $1,000 once the initial down payment is depleted.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Who owns the design once it’s finished and paid for?</h3>
						<p>The works is yours upon receipt of final payment. We do, however, reserve the right to use any work for promotional purposes and reuse non proprietary elements.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>What if I have a budget?</h3>
						<p>We sure hope you have a budget so we can understand your priorities and help you  figure out the most effective way of reaching your goals. If we can accomplish that within your budget great, if not we can try to facilitate/refer you with an "up and coming artist"</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Do I need to pay even if I don't like the design?</h3>
						<p>Yes!</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>But why?</h3>
						<p>1) time is money 2) design is subjective 3) as the experts here, assume that we know what's best and that when you get older you’ll understand.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<h3>Why should I pay you to build a site I can build myself?</h3>
						<p>We’ll get back to you on that one.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Can I pay you in equity?</h3>
						<p>We’d be happy to hear your proposal.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Can you do it for free, it would give you free exposure?</h3>
						<p>Youre a genius, want to join our team... for free? ;)</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Do i get a referral commision?</h3>
						<p>This was an idea we actually thought about but decided against it. We want all our clients to come our way on our own merits and not just because a broker pushed them in our direction to earn a buck.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>can i get a special discount for this very important project?</h3>
						<p>Most of our clients are doing holy or important work so we just put the discount in the initial price. Keep up your great work!</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<h3>how do i pay?</h3>
						<p>You can use any of the following methods: <br>
						Cash <br>
						Check payable to Lemon Place Inc. <br>
						PayPal</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Why are you still sending me invoices seven months after the project finished?</h3>
						<p>How else can we afford to buy lunch and keep the lights on?</p>
					</li>
